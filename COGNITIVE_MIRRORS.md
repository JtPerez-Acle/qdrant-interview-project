# Cognitive Mirrors Approach

This document provides a detailed explanation of the Cognitive Mirrors approach used in Contexto-Crusher to improve word guessing efficiency.

## 1. Conceptual Overview

The Cognitive Mirrors approach is based on the principle that "reasoning improves when a model can see its own thoughts." In the context of Contexto-Crusher, this means implementing a recursive, self-critical reasoning loop that:

1. Proposes candidate words
2. Reflects on the patterns and relationships between these candidates and previous guesses
3. Refines the candidates based on this reflection
4. Selects the best candidate to guess

This approach transforms a simple nearest-neighbor search into an adaptive search policy that can navigate the semantic space more efficiently.

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1 Critic

The critic analyzes the current state of the solving process, including:
- The current set of candidate words
- The history of previous guesses and their rankings
- The patterns and trends in the rankings

It generates a reflection that identifies potential issues, patterns, and opportunities for improvement.

### 2.2 Reflection

The reflection is a structured analysis that includes:
- Observations about the current search trajectory
- Identification of potential semantic basins or local minima
- Detection of polysemous clusters that might be overlooked
- Suggestions for shifting word morphology or semantic domain

### 2.3 Refinement

The refinement process uses the reflection to:
- Re-rank candidate words
- Generate new candidates in promising directions
- Eliminate candidates that are unlikely to be productive
- Adjust the search strategy based on insights

## 3. Implementation Details

### 3.1 Introspective Questions

The Cognitive Mirrors loop asks itself a series of introspective questions, including:

#### Semantic Basin Analysis
- "Are we stuck in a local semantic basin?"
- "Is there a broader semantic category we're missing?"
- "Are our guesses too semantically similar to each other?"

#### Polysemy Detection
- "Do ranks suggest a polysemous cluster we ignored?"
- "Could the target word have multiple meanings we haven't explored?"
- "Are there unexpected rank jumps that suggest alternative meanings?"

#### Morphology Shifts
- "Should we pivot word morphology (noun â†’ verb)?"
- "Have we tried different parts of speech?"
- "Are we focusing too much on one grammatical form?"

#### Domain Analysis
- "Are we in the right conceptual domain?"
- "Should we explore a different subject area?"
- "Is there a domain shift suggested by the ranking patterns?"

### 3.2 Reflection Process

The reflection process follows these steps:

1. **Analyze History**: Examine the history of guesses and their rankings
   ```python
   def analyze_history(history):
       """Analyze patterns in guess history."""
       rank_trends = calculate_rank_trends(history)
       semantic_clusters = identify_semantic_clusters(history)
       domain_distribution = analyze_domain_distribution(history)
       return Analysis(rank_trends, semantic_clusters, domain_distribution)
   ```

2. **Generate Questions**: Based on the analysis, generate relevant introspective questions
   ```python
   def generate_questions(analysis):
       """Generate introspective questions based on analysis."""
       questions = []
       if analysis.has_plateau():
           questions.append("Are we stuck in a local semantic basin?")
       if analysis.has_rank_jumps():
           questions.append("Do ranks suggest a polysemous cluster we ignored?")
       # More question generation logic...
       return questions
   ```

3. **Answer Questions**: Provide answers to the questions based on the current state
   ```python
   def answer_questions(questions, history, candidates):
       """Answer introspective questions."""
       answers = {}
       for question in questions:
           if "semantic basin" in question:
               answers[question] = analyze_semantic_basin(history, candidates)
           # More answer generation logic...
       return answers
   ```

4. **Generate Insights**: Derive actionable insights from the questions and answers
   ```python
   def generate_insights(questions, answers):
       """Generate insights from questions and answers."""
       insights = []
       for question, answer in zip(questions, answers):
           if answer.confidence > 0.7:
               insights.append(Insight(
                   type=answer.type,
                   description=answer.description,
                   confidence=answer.confidence,
                   suggested_action=answer.suggested_action
               ))
       return insights
   ```

5. **Formulate Reflection**: Combine the insights into a coherent reflection
   ```python
   def formulate_reflection(insights):
       """Formulate a coherent reflection from insights."""
       reflection_text = "Based on the current guesses and their rankings, I observe:\n"
       for insight in insights:
           reflection_text += f"- {insight.description} ({insight.confidence:.2f} confidence)\n"
       reflection_text += "\nSuggested actions:\n"
       for insight in insights:
           if insight.suggested_action:
               reflection_text += f"- {insight.suggested_action}\n"
       return Reflection(
           text=reflection_text,
           insights=insights,
           suggested_pivots=[i.suggested_action for i in insights if i.suggested_action]
       )
   ```

### 3.3 Refinement Process

The refinement process uses the reflection to improve candidate selection:

1. **Apply Insights**: Modify the search strategy based on insights
   ```python
   def apply_insights(insights, vector_db, history):
       """Apply insights to modify search strategy."""
       modified_strategy = copy.deepcopy(default_strategy)
       for insight in insights:
           if insight.type == "semantic_basin":
               modified_strategy.exploration_weight *= 1.5
           elif insight.type == "polysemy":
               modified_strategy.add_alternative_meanings = True
           # More strategy modifications...
       return modified_strategy
   ```

2. **Generate New Candidates**: Use the modified strategy to generate new candidates
   ```python
   def generate_new_candidates(strategy, vector_db, history):
       """Generate new candidates using the modified strategy."""
       if strategy.add_alternative_meanings:
           candidates = generate_polysemous_candidates(vector_db, history)
       else:
           candidates = vector_db.search(estimate_target_vector(history), limit=strategy.candidate_count)
       
       if strategy.exploration_weight > 1.0:
           diverse_candidates = generate_diverse_candidates(vector_db, history)
           candidates = merge_candidates(candidates, diverse_candidates, strategy.exploration_weight)
       
       return candidates
   ```

3. **Re-rank Candidates**: Adjust candidate rankings based on reflection
   ```python
   def rerank_candidates(candidates, reflection, history):
       """Re-rank candidates based on reflection."""
       scores = {}
       for candidate in candidates:
           base_score = calculate_base_score(candidate, history)
           reflection_bonus = calculate_reflection_bonus(candidate, reflection)
           scores[candidate] = base_score + reflection_bonus
       
       return sorted(candidates, key=lambda c: scores[c], reverse=True)
   ```

## 4. Example Workflow

Here's an example of how the Cognitive Mirrors loop might work in practice:

1. **Initial Guesses**:
   - Guess: "paper" â†’ rank 823
   - Guess: "document" â†’ rank 172
   - Guess: "book" â†’ rank 45

2. **Reflection**:
   ```
   Based on the current guesses and their rankings, I observe:
   - We're in the domain of written materials (0.85 confidence)
   - The rankings are improving rapidly, suggesting we're on the right track (0.90 confidence)
   - The target might be a specific type of historical document (0.75 confidence)
   
   Suggested actions:
   - Explore more specific historical document types
   - Try older forms of writing materials
   - Consider ancient writing formats
   ```

3. **Refined Candidates**:
   - "manuscript" (from vector similarity + reflection bonus for historical document)
   - "scroll" (from reflection suggestion for ancient writing formats)
   - "parchment" (from reflection suggestion for older writing materials)
   - ...

4. **Next Guess**:
   - Guess: "manuscript" â†’ rank 23

5. **Updated Reflection**:
   ```
   Based on the current guesses and their rankings, I observe:
   - We're getting closer with historical document types (0.92 confidence)
   - Ancient writing formats might be the right direction (0.85 confidence)
   - The material aspect might be important (0.78 confidence)
   
   Suggested actions:
   - Try specific ancient writing formats
   - Consider materials used in ancient documents
   - Focus on Egyptian or Middle Eastern writing systems
   ```

6. **Further Refined Candidates**:
   - "scroll" (from ancient writing formats)
   - "papyrus" (from Egyptian writing materials)
   - "tablet" (from ancient writing formats)
   - ...

7. **Next Guess**:
   - Guess: "scroll" â†’ rank 5

8. **Final Reflection**:
   ```
   Based on the current guesses and their rankings, I observe:
   - We're very close with ancient writing formats (0.95 confidence)
   - Egyptian writing materials seem promising (0.90 confidence)
   - The material aspect is definitely important (0.88 confidence)
   
   Suggested actions:
   - Try "papyrus" as it combines the concepts of ancient Egyptian writing material
   ```

9. **Final Guess**:
   - Guess: "papyrus" â†’ rank 1 ðŸŽ‰

## 5. Benefits Over Simple Vector Search

The Cognitive Mirrors approach offers several advantages over a simple vector search:

1. **Adaptive Strategy**: Adjusts search strategy based on feedback
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies patterns in rankings that simple vector similarity might miss
3. **Domain Awareness**: Develops awareness of the conceptual domain of the target
4. **Polysemy Handling**: Better handles words with multiple meanings
5. **Exploration Balance**: Dynamically balances exploration vs. exploitation

## 6. Implementation Considerations

### 6.1 Introspection Depth

The number of reflection iterations affects performance:
- **1 iteration**: Basic reflection, minimal overhead
- **2 iterations**: Good balance of insight and efficiency (recommended)
- **3+ iterations**: Diminishing returns, increased latency

### 6.2 Reflection Quality

The quality of reflections depends on:
- Diversity of introspective questions
- Accuracy of pattern recognition
- Quality of insight generation
- Effectiveness of strategy adjustments

### 6.3 Integration with Vector Search

The Cognitive Mirrors loop should:
- Start with vector search as a foundation
- Use reflection to guide and refine the search
- Maintain a balance between vector similarity and reflection insights
- Adapt the weight of reflection based on its historical effectiveness
