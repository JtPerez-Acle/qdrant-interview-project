## Development Approach

### Test-Driven Development
1. Write failing tests for each component
2. Implement minimum code to pass tests
3. Refactor while maintaining test coverage
4. Repeat for each feature

### Incremental Integration
1. Develop components in isolation
2. Integrate components one at a time
3. Test integration points thoroughly
4. Build up to complete system

### Continuous Evaluation
1. Regularly evaluate performance on test puzzles
2. Track metrics over time
3. Identify and address performance regressions
4. Document improvements

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **Embedding quality**: If embeddings don't capture semantic relationships well
  - *Mitigation*: Test multiple embedding models, implement fallback strategies

- **Rate limiting**: If Contexto.me implements strict rate limiting
  - *Mitigation*: Implement backoff strategies, cache results, use historical puzzles for development

- **Performance issues**: If system is too slow for practical use
  - *Mitigation*: Profile early, optimize critical paths, implement caching

### Schedule Risks
- **Component complexity**: If components take longer than expected to implement
  - *Mitigation*: Start with simplified versions, add complexity incrementally

- **Integration challenges**: If components don't work together as expected
  - *Mitigation*: Define clear interfaces early, use mocks for development

## Success Criteria

The MVP will be considered successful when:
1. It achieves an average of ≤7 guesses across 100 consecutive daily puzzles
2. It runs entirely offline on a laptop (no external API calls)
3. It completes puzzles in a reasonable time (< 30 seconds per puzzle)
4. It has comprehensive test coverage (>80%)
5. Documentation is complete and clear
